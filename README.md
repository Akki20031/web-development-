# Spotify Clone Website



## Problem Statement

Goal: The goal of this project is to create a Spotify Clone that mimics the core functionalities of the original Spotify web player, allowing users to play songs, skip tracks, view album covers, and see a live progress timeline. The Spotify clone is designed to be visually appealing and user-friendly with interactive features, such as playing songs directly from a list and viewing animated playback.

The objective of this project is to implement a music player interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project is aimed at replicating basic functionalities, such as:

Song Playback Controls: Users can play, pause, skip to the next or previous song, and see a live timeline update.
Song List: A container displaying 10 songs, each with its own cover and play button for direct song selection.
Interactive Timeline: A dynamic timeline that updates as the song plays and allows users to scrub through the track.
Playback Animation (GIF): A playing GIF animation is shown while a song is being played.
Visually Appealing Design: The site includes a Spotify logo, background, and well-designed UI elements to provide an aesthetic experience similar to the actual Spotify platform.
This project focuses on providing a functional music player UI that transforms static elements (such as album covers) into an interactive experience.



### Steps followed 
Step 1: Load the Required Assets
10 song files (in .mp3 format) and 10 album cover images were prepared for use.

Spotify's logo and background images were added to the project to replicate the aesthetic of the Spotify app.

Step 2: Build the Structure Using HTML
Header Section: The Spotify logo was added to the top-left corner of the page.

Song List Section: A container was created to display 10 songs, each with its own cover image, title, and play button.

Music Player Section: A footer section was added that contains:
Play, Next, and Previous buttons.

A dynamic progress bar for the timeline.

A display area for the currently playing song title.

An animated GIF that is displayed when a song is playing.

Step 3: Style the Page with CSS
Spotify-Like Theme: CSS was used to create a layout that mimics the look of Spotify, with album covers neatly displayed, and a music player at the bottom of the page.

Responsive Design: The page was designed to be responsive, ensuring it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
Custom Buttons: Play, pause, next, and previous buttons were styled using CSS for a modern and minimalistic look.


Step 4: Implement Functionality Using JavaScript
Play, Pause, Next, Previous: JavaScript was used to control the playback functionality. Users can:

Play a song from the song list by clicking the play button next to it.
Pause and resume the currently playing song.
Skip to the next or previous song using dedicated buttons.

Dynamic Timeline: A JavaScript function was written to update the progress bar as the song plays.
 The user can also click on the progress bar to scrub to any part of the song.

Playing GIF Animation: An animated GIF was displayed while a song is playing, which stops when the song is paused or stopped.

Song List Functionality: Each song in the list has a play button, allowing users to play any song directly from the list.
